/**
 * A port of Blackman and Vigna's xoroshiro 128+ generator; should be very fast and produce high-quality output.
 * Testing shows it is within 5% the speed of LightRNG, sometimes faster and sometimes slower, and has a larger period.
 * It's called XoRo because it involves Xor as well as Rotate operations on the 128-bit pseudo-random state.
 * <br>
 * {@link LightRNG} is also very fast, but relative to XoRoRNG it has a significantly shorter period (the amount of
 * random numbers it will go through before repeating), at {@code pow(2, 64)} as opposed to XorRNG and XoRoRNG's
 * {@code pow(2, 128) - 1}, but LightRNG also allows the current RNG state to be retrieved and altered with
 * {@code getState()} and {@code setState()}. For most cases, you should decide between LightRNG, XoRoRNG, and other
 * RandomnessSource implementations based on your needs for period length and state manipulation (LightRNG is also used
 * internally by almost all StatefulRNG objects). You might want significantly less predictable random results, which
 * {@link IsaacRNG} can provide, along with a large period. You may want a very long period of random numbers, which
 * would suggest {@link LongPeriodRNG} as a good choice or {@link MersenneTwister} as a potential alternative. You may
 * want better performance on 32-bit machines or on GWT, where {@link Zag32RNG} is currently the best choice almost all
 * of the time, and {@link ThrustAlt32RNG} can be better only when distribution and period can be disregarded in order
 * to improve speed somewhat. These all can generate pseudo-random numbers in a handful of nanoseconds (with the key
 * exception of 64-bit generators being used on GWT, where they may take more than 100 nanoseconds per number), so
 * unless you need a LOT of random numbers in a hurry, they'll probably all be fine on performance. You may want to
 * decide on the special features of a generator, indicated by implementing {@link StatefulRandomness} if their state
 * can be read and written to, and/or {@link SkippingRandomness} if sections in the generator's sequence can be skipped
 * in long forward or backward leaps.
